				<p>When Microsoft officially announced their new web browser and I saw the logo, I had to do something. It didn't look symmetric and frankly, <em>it just looked like Sonic the Hedgehog.</em> So I took it upon myself to redesign it.</p>

				<img class="small" src="./img/microsoft-edge-2.png">
				<p>I changed the colour to a nice light blue and added a small icon to their inital 'e'. I think the 'edge' really needed to be expressed because the original was too abstract.</p>
				<p>In the end, I liked the bottom left one because it had an icon that represented both the name and the drawing feature it has. You can learn more about the new browser <a target="_blank" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/browser-for-doing?wt.mc_id=MM13J6">here</a>.</p>
